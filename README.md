Ways to maximize efficiency for bar inventory at Upstairs at Pier 38

This is going to be an attempt at a resume builder. 

## GOAL
--- To be able to run a program efficiently after inventory has been accounted for, and not only compile necessary orders into a new spread sheet, but to also add the total of all costs and email them to the Bar Manager automatically. 

### Note:
The initial program will be run in a notebook file initially to ensure maximum accuracy of compilation of the new order. Once 100% accuracy is achieved, the notebook will be converted to a .py file to reduce runtime. 

## Tools Utilized:
* ### Python
* NumPy
* Pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* ### SQL
* postgresql
* sqlite (potentially)
